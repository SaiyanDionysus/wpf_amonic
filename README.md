Some desctiption:
1. I created a Login Form in XAML and then made a code-behind with connected sqlite db for auth users;
   - added 2 users in db and checked the functionalluty - everything is fine ;D
2. Also was done a form of adding new users from the side of administrator of the airline service, where we have:
   - email
   - first name
   - last name
   - office
   - date of birth
   - password
3. After making a form I also wrote a code-behind, where I used a sql connection to the SQLite DB for adding new users in that form. Btw, there are also were 2 buttons "Save" and "Cancel.
   when u click "cancel" it returns you on the login form (it's temporary) and when you click "save" - you are saving your data in db
4. Soon...
